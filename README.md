This is the second udacity project for the android developer nanodegree.

## What do I do about the API key for The Movie DB?
In order to run the application, you will need to create an additional values
resource file called secrets.xml. This will be where you store the api key for
The Movie DB. The file should look like this:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="movie_db_api_key">ENTER YOUR API KEY</string>
</resources>
